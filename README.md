# [1] About the Project

## Why SCABLE?
### SCABLE is designed to help organizations build a secure software supply chain by automating **software component analysis** and **license management**.
### It leverages **CodeQL Taint Analysis** to efficiently identify real security threats and focuses on supply chain security management with features like:
 - Typosquatting detection
 -  License compliance
 -  Real-time CI/CD integration


## Features

### SCABLE provides six key functionalities:

- 🛠️ **Automated SBOM Generation**  
  Generate SBOMs in CycloneDX, SPDX, and SWID formats.

- 🛡️ **Identification of Real Threats**  
  Identify real security threats among vulnerabilities detected in SBOMs using advanced analysis.

- 🔍 **Open-Source License Analysis**  
  Ensure compliance by analyzing open-source licenses in your software.

- 🕵️ **Detection of Typosquatting & Malicious Packages**  
  Detect typosquatting attempts and analyze dependency reputation.

- 📊 **Dashboard Reporting**  
  Visualize SBOM analysis results in a user-friendly dashboard.

- ⚙️ **Seamless CI/CD Integration**  
  Integrate into CI/CD pipelines for automated security and compliance checks.

# [2] Getting Started

## Prerequisites
### SCABLE requires three ports for smooth operation:
- **8282**: Initial setup and SBOM generation/analysis requests.
- **5173**: Dashboard for viewing analysis results.
- **8080**: Used for Jenkins integration (optional).

## Installation

### 1. Using Docker
```bash
git clone https://github.com/2024-scable/scable
docker compose up -d
```

### 2. Direct Installation on Linux
```bash
apt update && apt install -y curl
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/2024-scable/scable/main/setup.sh | bash
```


# [3] API Reference
## 1. /sbom
Generates SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) in three standard formats: CycloneDX, SWID, and SPDX.

Tracks "Reachable Components" affected by user input and visualizes the analysis results on the web page.

> **⚠️ Important Note:**  
> SCABLE **currently provides robust analysis for Python-based projects** and is actively evolving to include support for **additional programming languages** in the near future.  
> This will enable **broader compatibility** and adaptability for various development environments.
